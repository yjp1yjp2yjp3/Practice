Question:

Given a specific date, write a function to return the day of the year for that date. The signature of the function is

         int dayOfYear(int year, int month, int day)

 
For example, given input of year=2016, month=1, day=3. The function should return 3 as the date 2016-01-03 is the 3rd day of the year 2016.

Another example, given input of year=2016, month=2, day=1. The function should return 32 as the date 2016-02-01 is the 32nd day of the year 2016.
